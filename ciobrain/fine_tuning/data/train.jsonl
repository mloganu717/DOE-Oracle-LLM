It focuses on testing interactions between parameters to identify software faults efficiently. Dr. Wong's research has demonstrated that most software failures are caused by interactions between a small number of parameters (typically 2-6), making CT an effective approach for reducing test suite size while maintaining high fault detection capability. His work has shown that t-way testing, where t represents the interaction strength, can detect up to 90% of faults with significantly fewer test cases than exhaustive testing."}]}
