According to his work, CT focuses on testing interactions between parameters to identify software faults efficiently. The key benefits documented in his research include: 1) Significant reduction in test suite size (80-90% smaller than exhaustive testing) while maintaining high fault detection rates (90-100%), 2) Effective detection of interaction-based faults that are often missed by traditional testing methods, 3) Systematic coverage of parameter combinations, ensuring no critical interactions are overlooked, and 4) Practical applicability across various domains including safety-critical systems, where it has shown particular effectiveness."}]}
